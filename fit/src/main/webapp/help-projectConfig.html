    When this option is configured, Hudson is able to provide a direct link to the reports generated by Fitnesse.
    It is very important to provide an <b>index.html</b> file that points to the HTML reports generated by Fitnesse.
    If you have configured Fitnesse to generate a report called index.html, then you have nothing to do.
    If not, then you need to consider how to generate a file that would point to the other HTML files.
    <p>
    If you do not provide an index.html file, then you'll get a 404 error when trying to read the reports.
